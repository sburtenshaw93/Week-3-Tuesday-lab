    <p> Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
        Everything you want's a dream away
        We are legends, every day
        That's what she told him
        Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
        Everything you want's a dream away
        Under this pressure, under this weight
        We are diamonds
        Now I feel my heart beating
        I feel my heart beneath my skin
        I feel my heart beating
        Oh, you make me feel
        Like I'm alive again
        Alive again
        Oh, you make me feel
        Like I'm alive again
        Said I can't go on, not in this way
        I'm a dream that died by light of day
        Gonna hold up half the sky and say
        Only I own me
        Now I feel my heart beating
        I feel my heart beneath my skin
        Oh, I can feel my heart beating
        'Cause you make me feel
        Like I'm alive again
        Alive again
        Oh, you make me feel
        Like I'm alive again
        Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
        Everything you want's a dream away
        Under this pressure, under this weight
        We are diamonds taking shape
        We are diamonds taking shape

        And this adventure, oh then I
        Wanna share it with you
        With you, with you
        Sing it, oh, say yeah
